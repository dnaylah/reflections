When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working on a computer that isn't yours, or when the work will always be fully collaborated on,
  so no reason to store any copies separate from others on own machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	To make sure that all of the commits logged have some kind of significance or meaning and to keep the number of commits manageable.
