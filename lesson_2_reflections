What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	You can keep track of the changes to the files within the repository, along with knowing which branch you are on. Also tells if the initial commit still needs to be made. You can find all this using git status.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is different because it has not been fully committed to either the working directory or the repository yet. It is like an in between state where the user can decide to go forward with or not.
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	Branches are useful for testing experimental builds, or creating versions that are very similar yet slightly different. Rather than retyping all the code, can just reuse and change what is necessary. You can totally mess up one branch while maintaining the master branch.
	
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	The diagrams show the relationships between the branches and how they interact with other branches. It makes it more clear understanding how the branches grow and which ways they can get from one head to another.
